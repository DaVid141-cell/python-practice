# ü¶† COVID-19 Data Analysis Project  

## üìå Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 data to explore patterns, trends, and correlations across time, countries, and regions. Using Python, pandas, and visualization libraries, the project is divided into multiple activities ‚Äî each designed to highlight different aspects of the pandemic, such as worldwide impact, regional differences, time series trends, and external influencing factors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Environment  
The project was developed using the following tools and libraries:  
- **VS Code** ‚Üí Main IDE used for coding.  
- **Jupyter Notebook (inside VS Code)** ‚Üí Used for step-by-step execution and converting `.py` files into `.ipynb`.  
- **Pandas** ‚Üí For data manipulation, cleaning, and feature engineering.  
- **Matplotlib.pyplot** ‚Üí For generating basic plots and visualizations.  
- **Seaborn** ‚Üí For advanced statistical visualization and heatmaps.

## üìä Activities  

### **Activity 1: Data Loading and Exploration**  
- Loaded the COVID-19 dataset using pandas.  
- Displayed the first 5 and last 5 rows.  
- Checked for missing values and decided handling strategies.  
- Dropped columns with more than 90% missing values.  
- Converted the `'date'` column to datetime format.  

---

### **Activity 2: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**  
- Imputed missing values in key columns.  
- Removed duplicate rows.  
- Created new features (e.g., extracting year and month from `'date'`).  
- Explored unique countries and counted the total number of countries.  

---

### **Activity 3: Worldwide COVID-19 Overview**  
- Visualized WHO regions with total cases and deaths using bar plots.  
- Explored worldwide monthly case trends with line plots.  
- Investigated correlation between total cases and total deaths with a heatmap.  
- Analyzed case evolution over time for a specific country (e.g., India).  

---

### **Activity 4: Regional Analysis**  
- Created grouped bar charts for new cases by continent and month.  
- Visualized yearly total cases using box plots.  
- Compared total deaths across continents with bar plots.  
- Analyzed month-by-month total case progression with bar plots.  

---

### **Activity 5: Time Series Analysis**  
- Explored daily global trends for new cases and new deaths using line plots.  
- Calculated and visualized daily averages of cases and deaths.  
- Examined vaccination coverage trends over time.  
- Analyzed total tests and positivity rates using a log scale for clearer visualization.  

---

### **Activity 6: In-Depth Country Analysis**  
- Visualized specific country‚Äôs total cases and deaths over time.  
- Added user input to select a country and metric (`total_cases` or `total_deaths`) for line chart plotting.  
- Analyzed distribution of total cases across continents using box plots.  
- Visualized year-wise monthly trends of new cases for user-selected countries.  

---

### **Activity 7: Additional Insights**  
- Visualized global fatality rate trends (`total_deaths / total_cases`).  
- Explored positivity rate versus total tests using log-scale x-axis.  
- Investigated fatality rate correlations with smoking rates (male vs female).  
- Created heatmaps to analyze hospital bed availability versus fatality rates.
